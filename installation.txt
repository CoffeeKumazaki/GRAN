Follow the below steps for installing this repo. Some steps may require extra steps or tools, depending on the OS.

1. create a conda environment from the requirements.yml file.
    conda env create -f requirements.yml
    
2. activate the new conda environment
    conda activate gran
    
3. Navigate to the ./utils/orca directory and compile orca.cpp
    g++ -O2 -std=c++11 -o orca orca.cpp
    

Running after installation

Create a config file similar to those found in ./config/*.yaml

To train a model: python run_exp.py -c <path-to-config>

To test a model: python run_exp.py -c <path-to-config> -t

Keep in mind that testing will require defining the location of the model checkpoint to test with. The path to the checkpoint's directory must be set using the option test.test_model_dir, while the name of the checkpoint file should be test.test_model_name. The location of the saved checkpoint will be 
<exp_dir>/<model.name>_<dataset.name>_<timestamp>/model_snapshot_<epoch_num>.pth

It is important to correctly set the test_model_dir, as this is where generated images will be stored.
